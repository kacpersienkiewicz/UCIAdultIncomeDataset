The point of this repository is to use the Adult Census Data Set to predict whether a given person would make more or less than 50,000 dollars. Factors include occupation, age, education, or employment type ( private, public, self employed etc).

I will be using XGboost as the model, and then trying to optimize the algorithm to better predict the smaller class.
